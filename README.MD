# The complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2023. It is best Python course that I could find on Udemy. It has best overall rating. Let's check it :-)
***

I am going to upload some excersices and project from the course. If the difficulty of the project is even lower than 1/10 then I won't add it here. I will write here summary about projects that I made. 
First column represents name of the project.
Second represents the day of the course it was made.
In description column I wrote very short summary about project.
Fourth column represents difficulty of porject. 1/10 means project was very easy to make and 10/10 means it was very challenging.
In the next columns you can find all non-built modules that I used for the project and framework if it was built on it.
As projects get more and more complex and the number of modules increase, it gets harder to include every module here. Therefore from day 56 I started using virtual environtment and created requirements.txt where you can find modules with versions that I used for that project.
