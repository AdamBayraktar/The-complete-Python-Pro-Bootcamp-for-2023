# The complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2023. It is best Python course that I could find on Udemy. It has best overall rating. Let's check it :-)
***

I am going to upload some excersices and project from the course. If the difficulty of the project is even lower than 1/10 then I won't add it here. I will write here summary about projects that I made. 
First column represents name of the project.
Second represents the day of the course it was made.
In description column I wrote very short summary about project.
Fourth column represents difficulty of porject. 1/10 means project was very easy to make and 10/10 means it was very challenging.
In the last column you can find all non-built modules that I used for the project.
